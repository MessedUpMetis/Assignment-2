steps: 
1) made the changes to the website
2) we pushed to github

Yes, the conflict was we opened and modified two different index.html files after we pulled from github (Hunter created a new one).

To solve this, we both opened the correct index.html file, then we could see the changes we both made to the website.

We experienced no issues. There were two isssues. Hunter added a footer (per my request) and I modified the README.md (per Hunter's request). The steps taken were to simple start the respective files, modify them according to the issue, add them, commit them and push them. All of the files are executible, all of the issues are solved
